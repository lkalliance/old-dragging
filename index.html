        <p>This bit of code was a proof-of-concept that did not end up coming into being. The task was to convert an existing application into a web-based interface. This interface involved a lot of clicking and dragging, to record and measure short ECG strips out of a longer "full disclosure."</p>
        <p>Click anywhere in the full disclosure (the three lines of ECG at the bottom) to jump to that location in the main view. Drag the main view left or right to fine-tune the selection, and note that the red selection box in the full disclosure moves with your drag. Create an eight-second strip by control-clicking somewhere in the main view, and drag the yellow box left or right to fine-tune. Click "Submit" to lock down the strip. Create a set of calipers to measure heart rate by holding down the option key, and dragging in the main view. After releasing the option key, drag either border of the caliper left or right, and note the change in ms measurement and converted heart rate.</p>
        <p>This was all programmed in vanilla ES5 object-oriented JavaScript.</p>
